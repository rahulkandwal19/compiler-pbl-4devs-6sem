# Contributing to AutomonScript Language Engine (ams-lang)

First off, thank you for considering contributing to **ams-lang**! 
It's developers like you that make open-source language tools powerful, fast, and accessible. 

Whether you're proposing new language features, fixing bugs, improving our documentation, or optimizing the engine, your help is highly appreciated. This document outlines the process to ensure a smooth and collaborative experience for everyone.

## 1. Getting Started

1. Fork the repository or clone it to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AutomonScript/ams-lang.git
    ```
2. To work on the `ams-lang` engine, you will need the following installed in your local development environment. 

    Use the given scripts to install the required dependencies.

    ```powershell
    .\install_dependency.ps1
    ```
3. Run the installation script to build the project. On Windows, you can use the provided PowerShell script to perform a clean build. (It also sets up the environment variable `ams` pointing to `ams.exe`).
    ```powershell
    .\ams_install_windows.ps1
    ```
4. Use `ams` commands on your system. 
    ```powershell
    ams build .\examples\hello_world.ams
    .\examples\hello_world.exe   
    ```
